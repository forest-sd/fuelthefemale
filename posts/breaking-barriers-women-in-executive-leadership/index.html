    <article class="section"><h2>Breaking Barriers: Women in Executive Leadership</h2>
      <p>The landscape of executive leadership is evolving, but the pace of change remains frustratingly slow. While women now make up nearly half of the entry-level workforce in most developed economies, their representation drops dramatically at each successive level of leadership. Understanding why — and what works to change it — is essential for anyone committed to gender equity in the workplace.</p>
      <p>Research from McKinsey's annual "Women in the Workplace" study consistently identifies the "broken rung" — the first step from individual contributor to manager — as the most significant barrier to women's advancement. For every 100 men promoted to manager, only 87 women receive the same promotion. This gap compounds at every subsequent level, creating the dramatic underrepresentation seen in the C-suite.</p>
      <p>Organizations that have successfully increased women's representation in leadership share several characteristics. They set concrete, measurable diversity targets with leadership accountability. They actively manage their promotion pipelines to identify and address bias. They provide sponsorship (not just mentorship) programs that connect high-potential women with senior advocates who can open doors.</p>
      <p>The business case for women in leadership is overwhelming. Companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams are 25% more likely to achieve above-average profitability. Diverse leadership teams make better decisions, drive more innovation, and are more attuned to the needs of diverse customer bases. This isn't about charity — it's about competitive advantage.</p>
      <p>For individual women navigating the path to executive leadership, the journey requires strategic career planning, intentional skill development, visible leadership in cross-functional initiatives, and the cultivation of a strong professional network. It also requires resilience — the ability to persist through setbacks, navigate bias, and maintain authenticity in environments that may not yet fully value what you bring.</p>
      <p>The future of executive leadership will be shaped by the choices organizations and individuals make today. Every woman who breaks through to a senior role creates a path for others to follow. Every organization that commits to genuine equity — not just diversity theater — moves us closer to a world where talent, not gender, determines who leads.</p>
