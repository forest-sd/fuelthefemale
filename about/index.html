    <section class="section"><h2>About Fuel The Female</h2>
      <p>Fuel The Female was founded on a simple but powerful premise: the world is better when women lead. Research consistently shows that organizations with diverse leadership outperform their peers, communities with women in positions of authority see improved outcomes in health, education, and economic development, and societies that invest in women's empowerment experience faster progress across every metric of human wellbeing.</p>
      <p>Yet despite decades of progress, women remain underrepresented in leadership positions across virtually every sector. Only 10% of Fortune 500 companies are led by women. Women hold fewer than 30% of seats in national parliaments worldwide. And women entrepreneurs receive less than 3% of venture capital funding.</p>
      <p>Fuel The Female exists to change these numbers — not through a single approach, but through a comprehensive strategy that addresses the systemic barriers, skill gaps, and support deficits that hold women back. Our programs combine practical skill development with community building, mentorship with advocacy, and individual empowerment with collective action.</p>
      <h2>Our Values</h2>
      <p>We believe in equity — not just equality. We believe that leadership comes in many forms and that every woman's path is unique. We believe in lifting as we climb, ensuring that progress for some becomes opportunity for all. And we believe that the future of leadership is female — not to the exclusion of men, but in recognition that women's perspectives, experiences, and talents are essential to solving the world's most pressing challenges.</p>
